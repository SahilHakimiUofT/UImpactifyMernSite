## Tasks This Sprint
All tasks that were selected for this sprint were successfully completed.

This has been reflected on Jira.

## Practices to Continue
Majority of the practises to continue are the same as previously mentioned which are listed below with a few additions learned from this sprint.

Communication - Members continued to attend the daily meetings and on time and if they were unable to, they notified the team. 
Like in previous sprints, all group members one by one addressed their work for the day, what they were going to do next, problems/discrepancies, 
gave feedback, and guidance on other tasks. This helped the team to be prepared and organized each day. 

Collaboration - Team members continued to be respectful and committed to helping teammates solve problems. 
They posted in the chat useful materials/tools to help further develop our skills that were needed to finish the assigned tasks and user stories. 

Division of Work- Once again, all tasks were divided according to their estimate values and everyone had a meaningful contribution. 
Every teammate worked on an individual user story while also helping others if needed. The stories that were worked on in this sprint are listed below.

## New Practices
Since this was the conclusion of the sprints, there are no new practices to introduce however, going forward we should take what was discusses previously and continue to work on them.

## Practices to Avoid
Once again, an issue that occurred during this sprint was that some tasks were dependent on other which meant that some members were required to wait before they could start on their tasks.

## Best/Worst Experience
The best experience in this sprint was that since we have got a lot of the basic and main functionalities in the application done, 
whenever we start adding more features and aspects towards the program, not only does it get easier as we are comfortable and know our way around the system, 
but also the teammates feel a sense of accomplishment and motivation as they see their work implemented in the system and functioning perfectly resulting in a happy and 
motivated atmosphere where the teammates want to do better. 

This being the near the end of the semester meant that a lot of members were under pressure with other assignements which causes a bit of stress.
