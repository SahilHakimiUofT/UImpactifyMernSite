## Tasks This Sprint
All tasks that were selected for this sprint were successfully completed except TBD-13 (Wishlist for Learners) since only the frontend was done to display a test data of courses and not the backend for the wishlist button and obtaining the real wishlist courses from the database, so it has been moved to the product backlog.

This has been reflected on Jira.

## Practices to Continue
Majority of the practises to continue are the same as previously mentioned which are listed below with a few additions learned from this sprint.

Communication - Members continued to attend the daily meetings and on time and if they were unable to, they notified the team. 
Like in previous sprints, all group members one by one addressed their work for the day, what they were going to do next, problems/discrepancies, 
gave feedback, and guidance on other tasks. This helped the team to be prepared and organized each day. 

Collaboration - Team members continued to be respectful and committed to helping teammates solve problems. 
They posted in the chat useful materials/tools to help further develop our skills that were needed to finish the assigned tasks and user stories. 

Division of Work- Once again, all tasks were divided according to their estimate values and everyone had a meaningful contribution. 
Every teammate worked on an individual user story while also helping others if needed. The stories that were worked on in this sprint are listed below.

## Tasks Completed this Sprint

- TBD-12 - Drop Courses
- TBD-11 - Make Annoucements
- TBD-17 - See Applicant Details
- TBD-21 - Hire and Reject Applicants 
- TBD-9 - Ask Questions about courses

## New Practices
Since this was the conclusion of the sprints, there are no new practices to introduce however, going forward we should take what was discusses previously and continue to work on them.

## Practices to Avoid
Once again, an issue that occurred during this sprint was that some tasks were dependent on other which meant that some members were required to wait before they could start on their tasks.

## Best/Worst Experience
The best experience in this sprint was that since it was the last sprint we finally got to see our finished product and all the work the team had done throughtout the semester and to see all the components and hardwork integrated into the project and seeing it functioning as we envisioned was the most satisfying experience throughout this course.

This being the near the end of the semester meant that a lot of members were under pressure with other assignments an studying for exams which caused a lot of stress.
