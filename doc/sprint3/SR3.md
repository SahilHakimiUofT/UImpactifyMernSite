## Tasks This Sprint
All tasks that were selected for this sprint were successfully completed. All the subtasks that were created for each completed task have also been completed.

This has been reflected on Jira.

## Practices to Continue
Majority of the practises to continue are the same as SR2.md which are listed below with a few additions learned from this sprint.

Communication - Members continued to attend the daily meetings and on time and if they were unable to, they notified the team. 
Like sprint1 and sprint2, all group members one by one addressed their work for the day, what they were going to do next, problems/discrepancies, 
gave feedback, and guidance on other tasks. This helped the team to be prepared and organized each day. 

Collaboration - Team members continued to be respectful and committed to helping teammates solve problems. 
They posted in the chat useful materials/tools to help further develop our skills that were needed to finish the assigned tasks and user stories. 

The team should keep continuing to update the information on the tasks in Jira to be organized and up to date with the project. 

The team should be going through more materials and resources to increase our knowledge about MERN and JS.

Continue to ask questions and address concerns on piazza or with the Scrum Master in the Stand Up/Retrospective meetings.

Analyze the burndown chart to better allocate time towards the tasks/stories to make sure it is complete

Division of Work- Once again, all tasks were divided according to their estimate values and everyone had a meaningful contribution. 
Every teammate worked on an individual user story while also helping others if needed. The stories that were worked on in this sprint are listed below.

## TBD-5
Allowing a learner to check what classes they are enrolled in
## TBD-64
Allowing a social organization to be able to see the positions they have posted
## TBD-22
Learners can apply to open social initiative positions
## TBD-12 (not completed during this sprint)
Ability for the learner to drop a course
## TBD-20
Learners can enroll in a course 
## TBD-77
Consultants able to upload files/assessments related to their courses
## TBD-10
Allow consultants to edit their courses

## New Practices
Since the start of the project, the product owner has not been able to attend the Demos for each sprint. 
Therefore, the main new practise that should be done in sprint4 is to communicate with the product owner from time to time to make sure that they are updated on the tasks, 
user stories, and the applicationâ€™s progress so when the time comes, the product owner knows what to expect and is satisfied. 

## Practices to Avoid
Once again, even though we improved a great deal at this in sprint3, there was still two user stories that were dependent on each other causing certain members 
to wait before they can start on their task. The goal for sprint4 is to make sure there is close to no dependencies between the user stories.

Also, we still need to plan our time better to work on tasks as we do not want to be completing the work at the last day and rather look to leave a day before 
the demo/deadline to fully test the application and integrability of the features and adjust any changes/issues needed while making sure the user stories that we 
are suppose to have done in this sprint were successfully completed. 

## Best/Worst Experience
The best experience in this sprint was that since we have got a lot of the basic and main functionalities in the application done, 
whenever we start adding more features and aspects towards the program, not only does it get easier as we are comfortable and know our way around the system, 
but also the teammates feel a sense of accomplishment and motivation as they see their work implemented in the system and functioning perfectly resulting in a happy and 
motivated atmosphere where the teammates want to do better. The worst experience was that during this sprint a lot of the team members had multiple midterms and 
assignments causing a lot of stress and uncompleted tasks on time throughout the sprint decreasing morale and a negative impact on their time management and the project.
