- TBD-6
- TBD-16

## Practices to Continue

Communication - Members were great to help other group members work on tasks. Members attended the meetings daily and on time and if they were unable to for personal reasons, they notified the team. Also, if there were circumstances preventing them to talk in the standup channel, they messaged in the chat and contributed in the meeting throughout. All group members one by one addressed their work for the day, what they were going to do next, and feedback and help on other tasks. This helped the team to be up to date with tasks and organize their day better knowing what is the current status of the project.

Collaboration - Team members were respecting of others ideas and were committed to helping teammates solve problems. They posted in the chat useful materials/tools to help further develop our skills on MERN to accomplish our tasks with the best effort. 

The tasks that were selected this sprint had fewer dependencies, this meant that most group members were able to work without having to wait for another story to be completed.

## New Practices

If there are dependencies in tasks, then the team should focus on compeleting those first so no member is left waiting to start a user story.
Another practice that could be adopted is to use Jira to enter information about the work done and items pending for each task.

## Practices to Avoid

We need to plan our time better to work on tasks as we do not want to be completing the work at the last day and rather look to leave a day before the demo/deadline to fully test the application and integrability of the features and adjust any changes/issues needed.

## Best/Worst Experience

One of the best experiences of this sprint were that as a group we came together to help each other out.
