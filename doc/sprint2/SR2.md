## Tasks This Sprint
All tasks that were selected for this sprint were successfully completed. All the subtasks that were created for each completed task have also been completed.
This has been reflected on Jira.


## Practices to Continue
Majority of the practises to continue are the same as listed in SR1.md.

Communication - Members continued to attend the daily meetings and on time and if they were unable to, they notified the team. Similar to sprint1, all group members one by one addressed their work for the day, what they were going to do next, problems/discreptancies, gave feedback, and guidance on other tasks. This helped the team to be prepared and organized each day. 

Collaboration - Team members continued to be respectful and committed to helping teammates solve problems. They posted in the chat useful materials/tools to help further develop our skills that were needed in order to finish the assigned tasks and user stories. 

Division of Work- Once again, all tasks were divided fairly according to their estimate values and everyone had a meaningful contribution. A pair was working on the creation of courses (TBD-18), 1 was working on frontend of all courses provided to learner (TBD-6), 1 on posting open positions as a social organization (TBD-16), 1 on list of social initiatives and their information (TBD-14), 1 on learners being able to view what employment/volunteer oppurtunities there are (TBD-15), and lastly 1 on being able to add and see a description of the social organziation on their home/dashboard page (TBD-48). Everyone took part in the ideas and were content throughout the sprint. 

We should keep continuing to update the information on the tasks in Jira to be organized and up to date with the project. 

We should be going thorugh more materials and resources to increase our knowledge about MERN and JS.


## New Practices

For the next sprint we should start actively using more of the features in JIRA, for example, we should be daily updating our work logs for each task we do so that we can organize our timing better for sprint3, be much more efficient into allocating time wisely on each task, and have a record of the logs for future purposes. Also, we have to make sure that we do the user stories corresponding to the main functionalities of the application first so that way we can at least have a website that is suppose to do the normal functionalities required by the company, for example, login, signup, create courses, enroll in courses, post about positions, and more. 


## Practices to Avoid

Once again, even though we improved at this in sprint2, we need to select users stories that are less dependent on other tasks that are being worked on during the sprint to prevent team members from wasting time by waiting for the task to be done by others so that they can continue on with their work. 

Also, we need to plan our time better to work on tasks as we do not want to be completing the work at the last day and rather look to leave a day before the demo/deadline to fully test the application and integrability of the features and adjust any changes/issues needed while making sure the user stories that we are suppose to have done in this sprint were succesfully completed.


## Best/Worst Experience

The best experience in this sprint was that we were able to start on the coding aspect of the user stories and tasks right away as we have gotten comfortable with MERN and Git and were able to get work done faster as last time we had to watch tutorials and videos to increase our knowledge on tools/technologies used which took a lot of time. The worst experience was that during this sprint a lot of the team members were enrolled in a course that has been mismanaged since the start of the term and just these past few weeks they were surrounded by assignments in lectures all at once decreasing morale and a negative impact on their time management.
