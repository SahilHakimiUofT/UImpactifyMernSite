## Tasks This Sprint
All tasks that were selected for this sprint were successfully completed. All the subtasks that were created for each task have also been completed.
This has been reflected on Jira.


## Practices to Continue

Communication - Members attended the meetings daily and on time and if they were unable to for personal reasons, they notified the team. Also, if there were circumstances preventing them to talk in the standup channel, they messaged in the chat and contributed in the meeting throughout. All group members one by one addressed their work for the day, what they were going to do next, and feedback and help on other tasks. This helped the team to be up to date with tasks and organize their day better knowing what is the current status of the project.

Collaboration - Team members were respecting others ideas and were committed to helping teammates solve problems. They posted in the chat useful materials/tools to help further develop our skills on MERN to accomplish our tasks with the best effort. 

Tasks were divided fairly according to their estimate values and not one team member was overburdened. There was one person doing the login, 3 were doing the dashboard views for the three different users, and the other three were
working on the profiles. Everyone incorporated their own ideas into the project and were given tasks that they knew they can accomplish keeping the morale content. 

Keep continuing to update the information on the tasks in Jira to be organized and up to date with the project. 


## New Practices

For the next sprint we should start actively using more of the features in JIRA, for example, now since we have done the first sprint we have data that can be made into a chart that shows us how good our time estimates were and how much time did we actually need to complete our tasks compared to how long we thought it will take so that we can organize our timing better for sprint 2 and be much more efficient into allocating time wisely on each task.


## Practices to Avoid

We need to select users stories that are less dependent on other tasks that are being worked on during the sprint to prevent team members from wasting time by waiting for the task to be done by others so that they can continue on
with their work. 

We need to plan our time better to work on tasks as we do not want to be completing the work at the last day and rather look to leave a day before the demo/deadline to fully test the application and integrability of the features and adjust any changes/issues needed.


## Best/Worst Experience

The best experience in this sprint was that most of us started working with new tools and technologies that we never had the experience working with but always wanted to understand them and due to this sprint and project we gained beneficial knowledge that will help us accomplish our future goals and tasks in our work terms and jobs by using these tools and technologies. However, the worst part about it was that this did cause some issues as troubleshooting was also more difficult since we were still learning about the new tools.
