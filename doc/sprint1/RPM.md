## Meeting Notes
The release goals are to show new and improved functionality each sprint. Each release will be an improvment on the previous one and will show working components for items that were selected for that sprint. 

The tasks in Jira have been prioritized based on what needs to be implemented when and then an estimate assigned to it using the planning poker. Sprint one will focus on tackling the highest priority features - these usually take the longest but are critical for the application and for an MVP.

**The tasks selected for Sprint 1 are:**
- TBD-1
- TBD-2
- TBD-4

### Sprint 1 Release Goals
The release goal for this sprint is to have the login and homepages of all three user types completed and functioning. 
- TBD-1 needs to be completed and is the highest priority task, this will allow users (learners, consultants and social organizations) to create accounts and login to the web application. This is required to be completed so that users can access profiles and homepages that are tailored for them.
- TBD-2 relates to the homepages that the users will see once they have authenticated successfully. Users will be able to navigate the website using the navigation bar at the top and have access to their profile page where they can update their information.
- TBD-4 allows users to see their personal profile and update it. This page is important to have complete since it will be used later for the job boards and users need to be able to keep their information up to date.

### High Level Release Goals for Furture Sprints
As mentioned earlier, each sprint should include new functionality and improve on existing functionality (bug fixes) - if requried - therefore generally we will be selecting the highest priority items from the Product Backlog to work on each sprint. The priority has been set based on how critical the item is to get the application working. By the end, we hope to allow consultants to create and manage courses and for leaners to be able to join them. We also hope to allow learners to view information about social initiatives and apply to any jobs/volunteer positions posted by the initiatives.
