## Meeting Notes
- Some tasks have multiple items or interfaces that need to be created and as such will be split amongst the team for development in order to complete the task within the sprint.

## Sprint Backlog
*All the items and information have been selected from Jira*

| Task ID | Task Name | Task Description |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------- |

## Team Capacity
After the planning poker session the total estimate assigned to the entire Product Backlog was 102. To evenly spread the value of the items across the sprint we chosen to take items that would have a sprint value of around 25. 

We also tried to take the highest priority items in the product backlog.

The estimate for sprint 1 is 24.

## Sprint 1 Goals
The release goal for this sprint is to have the login and homepages of all three user types completed and functioning. 
- TBD-1 needs to be completed and is the highest priority task, this will allow users (learners, consultants and social organizations) to create accounts and login to the web application. This is required to be completed so that users can access profiles and homepages that are tailored for them.
- TBD-2 relates to the homepages that the users will see once they have authenticated successfully. Users will be able to navigate the website using the navigation bar at the top and have access to their profile page where they can update their information.
- TBD-4 allows users to see their personal profile and update it. This page is important to have complete since it will be used later for the job boards and users need to be able to keep their information up to date.

*Another key item from this sprint will be to learn how much we can realistic be done and use this knowledge to better select items from the backlog in each sprint*
