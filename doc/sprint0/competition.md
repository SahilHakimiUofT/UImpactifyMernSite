# U Impactify Competition

U Impactify has two different distinct sections. These being a:
Job Board to connect consultants and volunteers with social organizations
Online learning platform

We will discuss the competition that exists currently for these two markets as no one platform fulfils both roles simultaneously. 

## Job Board for employment, volunteering and consulting

There are many online job boards or websites that function to connect people with organizations. A few of these include but are not limited to:
- Glassdoor (https://www.glassdoor.ca/index.htm) 
- Indeed (https://ca.indeed.com/) 
- SmartRecruiters (https://www.smartrecruiters.com/resources/job-seekers/) 
- Freelancer (https://www.freelancer.com/jobs/) 

The first three serve more for employment and consulting opportunities than volunteering but any organization or individual can post on these forums and they are not restricted to social initiatives. Freelancer targets individuals who want to do contract work but also has postings from different types of organizations. 

U Impactify differs from these platforms since it solely focuses on social initiatives, all the job postings will be specific to this sector. For volunteers, this is better since it will be a centralized platform where they can search for social volunteering opportunities rather than trying to go to individual websites and reach out to the organizations. For impact consultants and potential employees, again they have a centralized location for jobs of their interest whereas the sites mentioned about have postings from all industries. This allows them to search for more specific items since all the jobs posted on U Impactify are restricted to social initiatives.

The sites did not focus on one industry because it goes away from their business which is to connect as many organizations with potential employees as possible. Picking a certain industry, will restrict traffic to the site and may lead to organizations advertising elsewhere. While users can search for postings related to social initiatives, for the websites to focus on this would mean they would have to rework their platform to focus on that industry and remove all other postings. 




## Online Learning Platform

Online learning is a concept that has become more popular in recent years. There are many companies and websites that are offering courses online as either a monthly subscription model or pay per course model.

Some of these include:
- Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/) 
- Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/) 
- Edx (https://www.edx.org/) 
- Linux Academy (https://linuxacademy.com/) 
- Pluralsight (https://www.pluralsight.com/) 

All the competitors mentioned here offer online courses. Coursera offers both a pay per course and a subscription-based payment model. Whereas, Edx and Udemy use pay per course models. Coursera and Edx, do not offer courses for individuals but rather all the courses are by universities or companies. 

Udemy, Linux Academy and Pluralsight offer courses by individuals. In the case of Linux Academy and Pluralsight, the instructors are selected by the organization whereas with Udemy anyone can create a course.

U Impactify differs from the competition since it offers a fixed number of courses simultaneously for a low subscription cost. This is something that none of the competition does. The competition that does offer subscription-based pricing is often very expensive. For individuals on the U Impactify platform, having a low subscription fee allows them to continue learning without the high cost. It also helps social organizations that want to encourage professional development in their employees.

The competition did not focus on this because in order to generate a profit they need a large number of courses and switch focus from what they are currently doing. For some of the competition, they are solely focused on technical courses such as Linux or DevOps and they would need to go out and get different instructors to change focus on more business-oriented items.

Another feature of U Impactify that helps it stand out among the competition is the Giving Garden feature which allows a consultant to get paid for work with an organization but the cost is supported by U Impactify instead of the organization. Donations can also be used to help fund consulting work for organizations. For the social initiatives, having a tiered pricing system for consultants makes it easier to negotiate and allocate budget for engagements since they know what pricing to expect.

Lastly, we would also like to talk about 5 other competitions U Impactify has to go up against in which the companies have very similar concepts and differences, they are:
- Zenler (https://www.newzenler.com/)
- Teachable (https://teachable.com/)
- Mighty Networks (https://www.mightynetworks.com/) 
- Thinkific (https://www.thinkific.com/) 
- Alura (https://www.alura.com.br/) 

Zenler is an all in one course creation, delivery, and marketing platform. Zenler allows users to create courses and sell them for a pricing model of their choice, it has email automations, tracking for students, easy page designer, and more.

Teachable allows their users to transform their experience and knowledge into selling courses, building a brand, or a coaching business. You create and sell online courses, the pricing is very expensive such as around $100 for a specific course, track your revenue, live lectures, feedback system, and more. 

Mighty Networks is a software company redefining the way influencers are growing their brands and followers. A new kind of website builder that grows with you. Bring your community, online courses, and memberships together in one place. Building your own brand by creating online courses, being involved with the community, and your own website through the builder feature. The pricing is either $81 or $23 or free per month depending on the plan.

Thinkific is a software platform that enables entrepreneurs to create, market, sell, and deliver their own online courses. Their mission is to revolutionize the way people learn and earn online by giving them the tools they need to turn their expertise into a sustainable business that impacts both them and their audience. Multiple multimedia course content, web designer, and multiple courses. The pricing is between $0, $39, $79, $399 per month depending on the plan.

Alura is an online platform that offers more than 1150 technology courses. It has high quality video classes, practical exercises, projects and in an active community with lots of discussions. Courses created and produced by the Alura team and the website is in Portuguese. Price ranges from $75 - $120 depending on the plan.

Now, how does U Impactify differentiate itself from this competition? Well, U Impactify is a capacity development platform for social initiatives where a social initiative can ask for employment, volunteer, and consulting support, an impact consultant can offer their offerings through e-learning, e-facilitation, e-coaching, and apply for consulting opportunities, and a impact learner can develop their capacity through learning from the consultant while also apply to jobs and volunteering opportunities. 

Basically, what all the other competitions are doing is focusing the company on one or more of these features but not all. U Impactify takes all the features the competition has and puts them all in one. 

This is why the product is better from the rest as it applies to a larger audience, three different types of groups, has low cost subscription, and gives support to a social initiative in the “Giving Garden” if they cannot afford to get any service. Also, if the consultant has certain number of clients, U Impactify themselves will pay consultants to serve social initiatives of their choosing under Giving Garden. One of the best parts is external donors can donate to the Giving Garden for impact learners and social initiatives to get support for free/ subsidized costs. U Impactify looks out for the less privileged and allows them to be offered the same knowledge and experience as others. That is what separates and makes U Impactify’s product better.

The reason the competitors did not focus on these users and scenarios is because they went with the standard buy and sell products model in which they allow users to create and sell their courses while building their brand for a pricing model they want, U Impactify also has a pricing model, but they also focus on the case in which they are unable to afford the services and they will help their clients out through the Giving Garden and external donors.
