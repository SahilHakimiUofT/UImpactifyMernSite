# Done

Each user story that we have selected counts as a feature. During our Sprint 0 discussion, we agreed upon a common definition of what done means in regards to a user story.

**Note:** A user stories and all its subtask has to be able to be completed in one sprint (2 weeks)

## Our Criterion of Done
- Code runs with no problems
- The feature passes all tests for each scenario and method
- Pull requests are peer-reviewed and approved before being merged onto the master branch
- The feature integrates with the other components without issue
- Matches the product owners expectations
- Acceptance criteria is met
