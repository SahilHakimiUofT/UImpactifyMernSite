# Our Process

## Reflection

Overall, the team worked well together, everyone was quick to respond in the group chat to any new messages or questions posted there and if a member was unable to make it to the meeting, they would let us know beforehand and would catch up with the information by looking at the notes the group took for the specific meeting which is available to everyone. During this sprint, we always met online as most communication took place through our Discord server for meetings, and Messenger was used for daily direct messages, but there was no need to call the members by cell as everyone responded on the other two communication channels on time. The team met daily to make sure everyone was up to date with which tasks are being assigned to who, the current status on each task, address any problems, and notify the plans of what they are suppose to do until the next meeting. 

Decisions were made through joint agreement, either with the entire group in agreement, or in the cases where there was a difference in opinion, we took the majority opinion as the decision after a discussion to understand everyone’s points. Everyone always had a say and was welcomed to speak their opinion on the ideas given and the other members would welcome it openly and discuss about the topics. 

The roles were divided evenly as everyone was given a single document to do out of all the requirements and were either working alone or a group of 2 or 3 depending on the difficulty of the task. Although, everyone had their own tasks, in the meetings we would always review our work with everyone and ideas for improvements were shared and implemented as this is a group project and we must succeed together with our best effort.  

Organizing the team was not hard at all as we all understand the job at hand and acted in a professional manner just as we would at our jobs. We simply exchanged our contact information and the communication channels (Messenger, Discord), and we were ready to start working. From then on we would all communicate with each other and everyone was up to date with what was happening with the project, meetings, tasks, and deadlines. The only tools used were Messenger/Discord for communication, Google Docs for our Sprint 0 documents, and Figma for the UI design.

## User Stories
	
The way our team will assign points to user stories is through planning poker with the fibonacci numbers as possible point values. If three to four rounds of planning poker still don’t result in consensus between members for a particular story, then that story will be re-evaluated (is it too long? Is it too vague? etc), rewritten, and we will attempt planning poker again.

The priority of the stories was determined as follows. Start with two stories and everyone discusses until there is a general consensus of priority. Then a third story is brought in and another discussion is had to determine where to place that one. And so on until all stories were prioritized.

## Lessons Learned

Looking back at this, the group performed well and we shared good information about tools and technologies that may be potentially chosen. We have learned that as long as everyone in the team is knowledgeable on the current status of the project, deadlines, meetings, and tasks, we can succeed together and help each other along the way with minimal issues arising, also you must work as a team to get your desired result because everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. In order to continue working as a team, apart from the continual daily standups we may need to have a weekly roundup that goes into more detail about what is happening throughout the week and targets for the next. In the weekly meeting we will give a brief summary of what work was done this previous week, what will be done by next week, and ideas on how we can be more efficient and effective.
