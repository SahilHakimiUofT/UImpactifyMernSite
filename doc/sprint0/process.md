# Our Process

## Reflection
Overall, the team worked well together, everyone was quick to respond in the group chat to any new messages or questions posted there. During this sprint, most communication took place through Facebook Messenger. 

Decisions were made through joint agreement, either with the entire group in agreement, in the cases where there was a difference in opinion, we took the majority opinion as the decision after a discussion to understand everyoneâ€™s points.

All meetings took place online. There was daily communication in the group chat with multiple meetings taking place over the last week of the sprint

## Lessons Learned from Sprint 0
Looking back at this, the group performed well and we shared good information about tools and technologies that may be potentially chosen. In order to continue working as a team, apart from the continual daily standups we may need to have a weekly round up that goes into more detail about what is happening throughout the week and targets for the next.
