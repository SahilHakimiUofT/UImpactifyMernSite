# UImpactify Project Summary


## Project Objective
Build a fully functional e-learning platform targeted towards the social initiative industry. Consultants and social organizations can run courses and have their employees focus on developing professional skills, ultimately leading to higher retention of long-term employees in this sector and higher overall job satisfaction. Individuals can also take courses offered by consultants on the platform. Social organizations can network with potential employees through the service as well.

## Key Personas
- The Learner: This person works in or wants to work in the social initiative industry and wants to develop skills to work towards their professional goals. Courses on UImpactify can help them develop specific skills for this sector while also helping network them with organizations that desire their skillset
- The Consultant: This person has experience working in the social initiative industry and has a skill that they want to teach and share. The consultant can request to create their own course on UImpactify and can choose how to run the course. They can have live or recorded lectures, post worksheets and make announcements with links to relevant articles.
- The Social Initiative: This person represents their social organization and can use UImpactify to train employees or help existing employees sharpen their skills. The organization can also network with potential employees on the application and see their skill set through completed courses.

## Key Use Cases/Usage Scenarios
- Sofia has worked for the Me to We foundation for 10 years and was recently laid off. In addition to her experience she needs to update her skills so that she can remain competitive when she applies to new positions. She takes two courses through UImpactify that are specific skills for the position she wants to apply for. She lists the courses on her resume and applies: her years of experience and readiness to learn in addition to her recently acquired skills are sought after and she receives many calls for interviews.
- Mo has been working at the World Wildlife Foundation as a Senior Communications Specialist, Food & Freshwater for over 15 years. He wants to have another stream of revenue while building his portfolio so that he can advance his career. He decides to apply to teach a course on UImpactify that highlights his expertise in the field. He is approved by UImpactify and can now share his experience with others who seek positions similar to his.
- Martha is a manager at Goodwill in the Youth and Young Adult Services Department and she has noticed that many employees that were motivated and passionate when they first started, ended up becoming uninspired months or years later because there was little room to grow. She takes this issue up with HR and decides to introduce courses on UImpactify to her employees. Goodwill covers the cost of these courses if an employee wishes to pursue it and it helps the company to retain their experienced and skilled workers for longer.

## Key Principles
- Clean and organized user interfaces over a multi-featured application: The application should be easy to navigate and not overcrowded with many features. The essential features are found easily and are intuitive to use.
- Quality of features over quantity of features: The application should have a few features that work well and are easy to use instead of having many that are difficult to use or do not work well.
- Software that is adaptable: The application should be built in a way that it is easy to add more features or modify it in the future without having to rebuild or rework a substantial amount of the previous project.
